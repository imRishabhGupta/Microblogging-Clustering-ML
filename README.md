# Microblogging-Clustering-ML
Classifying data is one of the most common tasks in machine learning.

#Dataset
With increasing popularity of social networking platforms like Twitter, Facebook, there is a tremendous increase in data each second. This data maybe in the form of text, pictures, videos etc.In spite of all these, textual data remains the primary way of learning the human behavior and current trending topics.

#Semantic Mapping
This project presents a text representation framework by harnessing the power of semantic knowledge bases, i.e., Wikipedia and Wordnet. The originally uncorrelated texts are connected with the semantic representation, thus it enhances the performance of short text clustering and labelling. The experimental results on Twitter dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in handling noisy and short micro-blogging messages.

#K-Means
Finally, the feature space is processed using unsupervised machine learning techniques. In this, hidden structures from unlabelled data are found and then use K-Means clustering technique, a popular method for cluster analysis in data mining. The resultant clusters are labelled according to the highest informative score of the word contained in the tweets of that cluster.

We hope, this project will help you give a start to machine learning world.
